        <p>The Bara Shaheed Dargah is a significant Islamic shrine located in the Dargamitta area of Nellore.

It is situated near the Swarnala Cheruvu (Golden Water Tank), which adds to the peaceful and spiritual ambiance.

The name Bara Shaheed means “Twelve Martyrs” and refers to twelve warriors believed to have been martyred in a battle over 1,200 years ago.

According to local tradition, the heads of these martyrs fell at the site where the dargah now stands, making it a sacred place.

There is an old stone inscription in Persian inside the dargah that tells the story of these martyrs.

The dargah is famous as a symbol of communal harmony, attracting people from various religions and communities.

<li>Festival: Rottela Panduga</li>

The dargah hosts a special annual festival called Rottela Panduga (also known as the Festival of Rotis) during the month of Muharram.

The festival lasts for three days and involves the exchange of rotis (flatbreads) among devotees as a sign of goodwill and blessings.

It is a time of prayers, communal meals, and cultural events, drawing large crowds from all over.
