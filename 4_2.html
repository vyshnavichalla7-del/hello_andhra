        <h2>History</h2>
        <ul><li>location</li>

           
        <p>
            The temple is located at Durga Mitta in Nellore city. It is a major spiritual center for devotees of Goddess Rajarajeswari, considered a form of Adi Parashakti — the Supreme Mother Goddess in the Shakta tradition.
        </p>
        <li>legend</li>
        <p>Goddess Rajarajeswari is worshipped as the Universal Mother, who combines the powers of Durga, Lakshmi, and Saraswati.

She is seen as both benevolent and fierce — bestowing knowledge, wealth, and protection.

The temple was established to spread Sri Vidya worship and practices.

Devotees believe the temple fulfills wishes related to marriage, health, prosperity, and spiritual upliftment.</p>
        <li>architecture</li>
        <p>The temple was constructed in the late 1960s, with its Kumbhabhishekam (consecration) completed in 1975.

It has a traditional South Indian Dravidian style, featuring a Rajagopuram (entrance tower) and intricately carved sanctum interiors.

The Mukha Mandapam (front hall) is spacious and often used for group rituals.

Sculptures of lions (symbolizing Shakti) stand at the entrance, and outer walls feature carvings of the 18 Shakti Peethams.

Inside, there are sub-shrines for:

Sri Sundareswara Swamy (Lord Shiva)

Sri Gayatri Devi

Lord Subrahmanya Swamy with consorts Valli and Devasena

Navagrahas (nine planetary deities)

Lord Ganesha.</p>
