            The Sri Kulandeshwara Swamy Temple is a revered Hindu temple located in Kattamanchi, a village in the Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh. This temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva, known here as Kulandeshwara Swamy.
           


<li>Legends:</li>
The temple is not only a place of worship but also a symbol of faith and resilience. The story of the Sthala Vriksha's rebirth and the installation of Vriksha Ganapati beneath it reflects the belief that divine blessings can restore and rejuvenate
<p>Sthala Vriksha: The temple is associated with a sacred tree, known as the Sthala Vriksha. According to local legends, this tree was destroyed due to natural calamities. However, a sapling of the same tree began to grow beside the original, symbolizing resilience and divine grace. A Vinayaka idol was installed beneath this sapling, and the deity came to be known as Vriksha Ganapati.</p>
