        <h2>history</h2><p>
            The temple is dedicated to Lord Venkateswara, who is also called Balaji.

It is believed that the deity in this temple is a form of Lord Vishnu who manifested here to bless devotees in the region.

Locals consider this temple an important spiritual center, especially because of its connection to the larger Tirupati Venkateswara tradition.

According to tradition, Lord Venkateswara’s blessings here bring prosperity, health, and spiritual upliftment.

The temple’s prominence increased as devotees believed this form of Balaji was accessible to all, irrespective of caste or community.

Some legends say this temple was established to serve as a local shrine where people who couldn’t travel to Tirumala could worship Lord Venkateswara.
            
        
<h3>architecture</h3>
<p>
    The temple follows the Dravidian style of architecture common in South Indian temples.

It has a main sanctum (garbhagriha) where the idol of Lord Venkateswara is installed in a standing posture.

The idol holds the traditional symbols — Shankha (conch) and Chakra (discus).

The temple features a gopuram (tower) at the entrance, decorated with intricate carvings and sculptures.

The mandapams (halls) have stone pillars with sculpted motifs and images of various deities associated with Lord Vishnu.

There are smaller shrines around the main sanctum for deities like Garuda (the eagle vehicle of Vishnu) and Hanuman (Anjaneya).

A temple tank (pushkarini) is present near the temple, used for ritual cleansing and religious ceremonies.

The materials used are mostly stone and granite, carved with detailed iconography depicting mythological stories.

The temple layout includes corridors (prakarams) for circumambulation and spaces for congregational worship.
