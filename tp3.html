        <h2>Overview<</h2>
        <p>
            Indira Gandhi Zoological Park is a vast zoo located amidst the scenic Eastern Ghats in Visakhapatnam district, Andhra Pradesh. Spread over 625 acres within the Kambalakonda Reserve Forest, it is the third largest zoo in India. The zoo was established in 1972 and opened to the public on May 19, 1977. It is named after the former Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi.

The zoo houses around 80 species of animals, totaling about 835 in number, including mammals, carnivores, reptiles, birds, and butterflies. The zoo is designed to provide a naturalistic habitat for the animals, with separate sections for primates, carnivores, ungulates, and birds. The butterfly and moth section educates visitors about their life and characteristics.

The park enjoys a unique location with the Eastern Ghats surrounding it on three sides and the Bay of Bengal on the fourth, making it an ideal environment for diverse flora and fauna. It is approximately 11 km from Visakhapatnam railway station, accessible via National Highway 5, and has two entrances/exits, one near the highway and the other towards Beach Road at Sagar Nagar.
