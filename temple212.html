Over centuries, it witnessed control transition from Vijayanagara Empire to Golconda Sultans, Mysore Kingdom, and British colonial rule.

The fort complex includes strategically designed walls, bastions, gateways, seven citadels, and structures blending Hindu and Islamic architectural styles.

Many temples are in a ruined or partially preserved state
