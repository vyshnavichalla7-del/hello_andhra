            <ul><li>
            Brighu Maharshi's Curse
</li>
According to one legend, the sage Brighu Maharshi, once tested the three main deities — Brahma, Shiva, and Vishnu — to decide who among them was most worthy of being worshipped.

When Lord Vishnu did not immediately respond to Brighu’s arrival, the sage kicked Him on the chest. Instead of getting angry, Vishnu forgave the sage.

However, the goddess Lakshmi was angered by this and left Vaikuntha, leading Vishnu to descend to Earth in search of her — this forms the broader story of Lord Venkateswara.

As part of atonement, Brighu is believed to have installed idols of Vishnu at multiple sacred spots across southern India.

Koneti Rayala Swamy Temple is believed to be one such divine installation, and it is said that Vishnu manifested here first before reaching Tirumala.
<li>
First Footprint of Lord Venkateswara
</li>
Another legend says that Lord Venkateswara's first footprint on Earth was at Keelapatla, at this very temple.

Therefore, many devotees consider visiting Koneti Rayala Swamy before going to Tirumala, as a preliminary pilgrimage.
<li>
 The Name ‘Koneti Rayudu’
</li>

The deity is affectionately called Koneti Rayudu by locals.

The name "Koneti" is said to be derived from the sacred tank (Pushkarini) located beside the temple, which is also called Koneti Cheruvu.

“Rayudu” is a respectful title for kings or noble deities in Telugu.

           
</p>
</ul>
<h3>architecture</h3>
<p>
    The temple is built in the Dravidian architectural style, commonly seen in South Indian temples.

It reflects influences from the Pallava and Chola dynasties, which once ruled the region
.
