        <h2>History</h2>
        <p> Legends say Lord Narasimha Swamy emerged as a swayambhu idol (self-manifested) from under the roots of the Kadiri (Indian Mulberry) tree, after slaying the demon Hiranyakashipu.

The earliest phase of the temple dates to the Chola period (985–1076 AD), with significant expansions completed by Bukka Raya I of the Vijayanagar Dynasty in 1353 AD and further additions by Harihara Raya and Sri Krishna Devaraya up to 1529 AD.

Kings from various dynasties made donations, added mandapas, and constructed gopurams, making it an impressive example of Dravidian architecture. Ranga Mantap and Alwar Shrine, decorated with depictions from the Ramayana and Mahabharata, were added during later periods. Shivaji Maharaj also contributed structures for Mahishasura Mardini within the temple compound.

The deity here is worshipped as Ashta Bahu Narasimha (eight-armed Narasimha), portrayed as tearing the demon Hiranyakashipu, with Prahlada standing in devotion beside him.
