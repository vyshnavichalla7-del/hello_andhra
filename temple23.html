        <h2>History</h2>
        <p> The temple was constructed between 1490 and 1509 CE by Pemmasani Ramalinga Nayudu I, a chieftain under the Vijayanagara Empire.

Its distinguishing feature is the Shiva Lingam, which is considered swayambhu (self-manifested), and it is always surrounded by water from an underground spring (“Bugga” in Telugu), a phenomenon that never dries up.

The temple showcases a blend of Chalukyan, Chola, and Vijayanagara art styles, with elaborate sculptures, unfinished gopurams (towers), and seven musical pillars in front of the Vishnu shrine that produce the “saptaswara” (seven musical notes) when struck.

According to local legend, the site is also associated with both Sage Parasurama’s penance and Lord Rama’s worship, adding layers of spiritual significance.

Inscriptions and miniature carvings representing the Shiva Purana as well as scenes from the Ramayana and Mahabharata adorn the temple.
