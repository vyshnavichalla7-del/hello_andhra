        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
        

Sri Kurmam Temple, located in Srikakulam district, Andhra Pradesh, is an ancient temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu in his Kurma (tortoise) avatar.
Originally, it was a Shiva temple but later converted into a Vaishnavite temple during the reign of the Eastern Ganga dynasty in the 11th century.
It is one of the few temples in India dedicated to the Kurma avatar of Lord Vishnu, symbolizing stability and cosmic support.
The temple showcases a fusion of Kalinga and Dravidian architecture and features ancient murals and a sacred tank called Swetha Pushkarini.
Legend says the temple was sanctified by visits from sages and deities, and Balarama once blessed the place, making it highly revered by devotees.
Sri Kurmam remains a significant spiritual and cultural landmark, attracting pilgrims and history enthusiasts alike.

This temple is dedicated to Lord Vishnu in his Kurma (tortoise) incarnation. It is an important pilgrimage site, especially during festivals related to Lord Vishnu. The templeâ€™s unique idol and architectural style reflect the devotion of ancient craftsmen.
