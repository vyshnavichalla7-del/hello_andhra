        <h2>history</h2>
        <p>Somarama Temple, also known as Someswara Temple, is a sacred Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva, located in Bhimavaram, West Godavari district, Andhra Pradesh. It is one of the five Pancharama Kshetras, which are famous temples linked by the legend of the demon Tarakasura. According to mythology, Tarakasura possessed a powerful Atma Linga that granted him immortality, which was broken into five parts during his battle with Lord Kumara Swamy (Kartikeya). Each piece of the lingam was installed in different places, forming the Pancharama temples, with Somarama housing one part installed by Lord Chandra (the Moon God). The temple dates back to the Eastern Chalukya dynasty and is notable for its Dravidian architecture and religious significance, attracting numerous devotees.
