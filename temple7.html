        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            The temple is an ancient shrine dedicated to Andhra Mahavishnu, believed to be an incarnation of Lord Vishnu and also revered as a great warrior king who ruled the region.

It was originally built by the Satavahana dynasty around the 4th century CE, and has been renovated several times, including significant contributions by the Chola king Anantha Dandapala in 1081 AD.

The temple is notable in Telugu literature as Emperor Sri Krishnadevaraya composed his famous work "Amukta Malyada" here in the templeâ€™s mandapam, inspired by a divine dream.

The deity, Sri Kakuleswara or Andhra Mahavishnu, is depicted uniquely with the conch (shankha) in the right hand and the discus (chakra) in the left, contrary to most Vishnu idols.

Over the centuries, the temple saw patronage from the Vijayanagara Empire and the Chalapalli Zamindars who managed its upkeep.

It is considered the 57th among the 108 sacred Vishnu temples (Divya Desams).
