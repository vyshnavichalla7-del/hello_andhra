<h2> History</h2><p>
Regapunyagiri, also known as Punyagiri Temple or Uma Kotilingeswara Swamy Temple, is an ancient Shiva temple located on the Punyagiri Hills near Srungavarapukota, about 25 km from Vizianagaram.
It is believed to be one of the oldest Shiva temples, with origins lost in time.
Local legends say that the Pandavas visited this sacred place during their exile.
The temple is built in traditional architectural style, with rockstone flooring and sandstone gopuram, adorned with carvings of deities and mythological stories.
       
The temple is known as “Dakshinakashi” (Kashi of the South), a major spiritual center where devotees believe that worshipping Lord Shiva here and bathing in the nearby holy pond can absolve sins and grant salvation (moksha).
It attracts thousands of devotees, especially during the grand Maha Shivaratri festival.
The serene environment, surrounded by hills and natural springs, enhances the spiritual atmosphere, making it a major pilgrimage and cultural site in the Vizianagaram region.</p>
