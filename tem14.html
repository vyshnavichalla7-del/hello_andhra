            History of the Temple
        The Panchaloha Idol of Lord Ayyappa and the huge Idol of Harihara were installed in 1989 by Swami Jayendra Saraswati. The holy 18 steps lead to the Idol of Lord Ayyappa which resembles the tradition of Sabarimala Ayyappa Temple. The temple complex has four floors and comprises of huge attractive shrines highlighted by architectural works and divine sculptures. It is believed that the negative influence of Lord Shani in horoscope can be kept away by worshipping in Dwarapudi Temple. Notable among them include Harihara Idol, Lord Nataraja, Shiva Linga, Lord Anjaneya Swamy, and Nandi. Devotees who cannot afford to go to Sabarimala to have makara darshan throng here to Dwarapudi.
        Special Poojas and Festivals
        On the day of Makara Nakshtra the Idol of Lord Ayyappa would be taken in a Swan-like-chariot from the temple complex to Medapadu Bridge. The rituals of the day start with Ganapathi Homam and after that Irrumudi Abhishekam is performed for the main Ayyappa Swamy idol. Thousands of devotees turn here to witness this festival.
        This is a temple complex where Swamy Ayyapa Temple and four floor high Eswara temple is located side by side. Popularly known as Sabarimala of Andhra Pradesh this temple is visited by many devotees of nearby places and those who canâ€™t afford to visit Sabarimala in Keral state conclude their Swami Puja here. This Ayyapa Gudi of Dwarapudi is located in East Godavari district.
