Chandragiri Fort is a historical fort located in the Chandragiri suburb of Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh.

It dates back to around the 11th century, originally built under the rule of Immadi Narasimha Yadava Raya.

It became especially important during the Vijayanagara Empire period. At one point, the capital was shifted there when Penukonda was under threat.</li>

üîç Historical Importance</li>
<li>

The fort was under the Vijayanagara rulers for about three centuries.

After the Battle of Talikota in 1565, parts of the empire changed hands; the Chandragiri area was later occupied by the sultan of Golconda around 1646.

It later came under Mysore rule and gradually declined after the late 18th century.

One key point in colonial history: in 1639, a treaty granting lands for Fort St. George (Madras) to the British was signed by the Vijayanagara king at Chandragiri.</li>

üèõÔ∏è Architecture & Layout</li>
<li>

The fort complex covers about 25 acres.

It‚Äôs divided into two major components: the Lower Fort and the Upper Fort. The Upper Fort is atop the hill, with bastions, ramparts, and watchtowers.

Inside the fort are several ruined temples (both Shaivite and Vaishnavite), palace structures, ponds, mandapas etc.

Two palaces stand out:

Raja Mahal: A three‚Äëstoreyed palace with intricate architecture typical of Vijayanagara style. It is now converted into an archaeological museum.

Rani Mahal: A two‚Äëstoreyed building nearby, once used for residence (and possibly commanders‚Äô quarters).

The buildings are constructed using stone, brick, and lime‚Äëmortar, with little or no timber in some of the major structures.
