        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          Mavullamma Ammavari Temple, located in the heart of Bhimavaram, Andhra Pradesh, is dedicated to Goddess Mavullamma, regarded as an incarnation of Mahakali and the village mother goddess. The temple's history became prominent around 1880 AD when the idol was discovered under a neem and peepal tree in Motipalli street, an area once covered with mango trees, from which the goddess's name evolved. The idol was partially damaged during the 1910 floods and later restored, initially appearing ferocious but was reshaped into a peaceful form by a sculptor. The temple is famous for its month-long annual festival celebrated in the Telugu month of Jyeshta, drawing devotees from across the region. It is situated close to the Somarama temple and holds a significant place in the spiritual and cultural life of Bhimavaram.
