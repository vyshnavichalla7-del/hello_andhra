        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            The Panakala Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy Temple is situated atop the Mangalagiri Hill, approximately 13 km from Vijayawada in Guntur District, Andhra Pradesh. This temple is one of the three Narasimha Swamy temples in Mangalagiri, the others being the Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy Temple at the base of the hill and the Gandala Narasimha Swamy Temple at the summit.

The temple is renowned for its unique ritual where devotees offer panakam (a sweet drink made of jaggery and water) to the deity. The idol of Lord Narasimha is believed to consume the panakam offered through a small opening in its mouth, with the remaining liquid flowing out, symbolizing the deity's divine presence and acceptance of offerings.

The construction of the temple is attributed to Sri Raja Vasireddy Venkatadri Naidu, a prominent Zamindar, during the early 19th century. The temple has completed over 200 years since its establishment, reflecting its enduring significance and the rich cultural heritage of the region.
