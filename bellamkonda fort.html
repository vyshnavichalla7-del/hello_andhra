        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Bellamkonda Fort, located in the Palnadu region of Andhra Pradesh, is a historic hill fortress with a rich and complex history. The fort is believed to have been constructed by the Reddi kings of Kondavidu, who ruled the region in the 14th century. After the decline of the Reddi dynasty in 1482, the fort came under the control of the Orissa kings. Subsequently, it was taken over by the rulers of Vijayanagara before finally falling into the hands of the Mughals in 1578, marking the end of Hindu rule in the area. By the late 18th century, during British colonial rule, the fort had a few troops stationed at the base of the hill in mud huts .

The fort is situated at an elevation of 1,569 meters above sea level and is roughly triangular in shape, enclosing an area of about one-sixteenth of a square mile. It features a single stone wall connecting elevated points of the hill, with bastions at the southeast and northwest corners .
