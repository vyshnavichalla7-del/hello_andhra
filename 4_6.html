        <p>Approximately 10 km west of Nellore town, on the southern bank of the sacred Pinakini River.
        </p>
        <li>legend</li>
        <p>The main deity is Lord Narasimha, worshipped in his Swayambhu (self-manifested) form.

Historical Significance: The temple is believed to have been established during the Chola dynasty and has been a significant center of worship for centuries.

Legends: According to local lore, Sapta Rishis (seven sages) performed a yagna (sacrificial ritual) at this site, and the temple stands at the spot where they conducted their penance
        </p>
        <p>Main Shrine: The sanctum sanctorum houses the Swayambhu Narasimha Swamy idol, which is naturally formed and revered by devotees.

Additional Shrines: The temple complex includes shrines dedicated to Sri Lakshmi Devi, Sri Subrahmanya Swamy, and Sri Visveswara Swamy.

Sacred Ponds: There are seven holy ponds within the temple premises, believed to have been created by the Sapta Rishis during their yagna.

Annadanam: The temple offers a free community kitchen (Annadanam) that serves meals to devotees daily.</p>
        <li>architecture</li>
        <p>Style: The temple exhibits classic Dravidian architecture, with influences from the Chola dynasty known for their robust and intricate temple designs.

Sanctum Sanctorum (Garbhagriha):
The main sanctum houses the Swayambhu idol of Lord Narasimha. The deity is carved naturally into the rock, which is quite rare and considered highly sacred. The sanctum is simple yet powerful in its spiritual presence.

Mandapas (Halls):
The temple has spacious halls (mandapas) for devotees to gather, perform rituals, and participate in festivals. The pillars here are adorned with traditional carvings of divine figures and mythological scenes.

Gopuram (Temple Tower):
The entrance tower is modest but intricately carved, typical of the Dravidian style with layers of sculptures depicting gods, goddesses, and celestial beings.

Sculptural Details:
Stone carvings around the temple walls and pillars showcase stories from the Puranas, especially episodes related to Lord Vishnu and his Narasimha avatar. The craftsmanship reflects Chola-era artistry with detailed motifs, floral patterns, and divine iconography.

Sacred Ponds (Pushkarinis):
The temple complex houses seven holy ponds, which are believed to have been created by the Sapta Rishis during their yagna. These water bodies add to the spiritual ambiance and are used in ritual purification.

Additional Shrines:
Besides the main deity, the temple complex contains smaller shrines dedicated to Sri Lakshmi Devi (Goddess of wealth and prosperity), Sri Subrahmanya Swamy (Karthikeya), and Sri Visveswara Swamy (a form of Lord Shiva). These shrines follow similar Dravidian architectural elements.
