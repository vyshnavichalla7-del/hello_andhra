        <ul><li>location</li>
        Udayagiri Fort is located in Udayagiri town, about 100 kilometers from Nellore city, Andhra Pradesh.

It is set in a hilly terrain and sits at an altitude of around 3,000 feet above sea level.
        <li>history</li>
    The fort dates back to the 14th century.

It was originally built by Langula Gajapati, a commander of the Gajapati rulers of Odisha.

Later, it was captured by Krishnadevaraya of the Vijayanagara Empire during his southern campaigns.

After the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire, the fort came under Golconda rulers and then the Nawabs of Arcot.

The site reflects a fusion of Hindu and Islamic architecture due to the changes in rule over the centuries.
