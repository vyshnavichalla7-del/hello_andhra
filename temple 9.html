        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The temple is located in Movva village in Krishna district, Andhra Pradesh, and is closely associated with the 17th-century poet-composer Mahakavi Kshetrayya, who composed thousands of devotional padams in praise of Lord Venugopala Swamy.

According to legend, once when Krishna danced, a bead (muvva) from his anklet fell on this land. Narada was sent to find it, and as a result of penance by Sage Moudgalya, Lord Vishnu appeared here in the form of Sri Venugopala Swamy.

The deity is considered swayambhu (self-manifested) in a sand sculpture form, and the temple is said to have been built before dawn by divine intervention.

The temple has separate shrines for Sri Venugopala Swamy and Godadevi and features intricate carvings and paintings illustrating stories from Krishna's life.
