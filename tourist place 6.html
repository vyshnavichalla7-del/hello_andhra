        <h2>HISTORY</h2>
        <p>The Prakasam Barrage stretches 1223.5 meters across the Krishna River, connecting Krishna and Guntur districts in Andhra Pradesh.

Originally constructed as an anicut (dam) by Sir Arthur Cotton between 1852 and 1855 to provide irrigation for around 7 lakh acres.

The old anicut was breached due to floods in 1952, leading to the construction of the current barrage from 1954 to 1957 at a cost of Rs. 2.78 crores.

Named after Tanguturi Prakasam Pantulu, the first Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, the barrage was completed in 1957.

It irrigates over 1.2 million acres and supplies water to the Buckingham Canal.

The barrage also acts as a road bridge and has 76 pillars, offering panoramic views over a vast lake.

It is a key infrastructure for irrigation, flood control, and regional connectivity.
