        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Thimmamma Marrimanu is the world's largest banyan tree, located near Kadiri in Anantapur district, Andhra Pradesh. It dates back to 1434 CE and holds a Guinness World Record for the largest canopy, covering 19,107 square meters (about 4.7 acres). The tree is over 550 years old and revered by Hindus, Jains, and Buddhists alike
The tree is named after Thimmamma, a devoted wife who, according to legend, performed sati (self-immolation) on her husband's funeral pyre in the 15th century. The banyan is believed to have sprouted from a pole of the pyre, symbolizing eternal love, sacrifice, and fertility.

There is a small temple dedicated to Thimmamma beneath the tree. Local belief holds that childless couples praying here will be blessed with a child within a year.

The site is culturally significant with an annual jatara (fair) on Maha Shivaratri, attracting thousands of devotees.  </p>
