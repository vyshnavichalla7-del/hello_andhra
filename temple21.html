        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>  The temple was constructed around 1530 CE by Virupanna Nayaka and Viranna, brothers who were Governors of Penukonda under the Vijayanagar Empire, during the reign of King Achyuta Deva Raya.

Legend suggests the site is associated with sage Agastya and also mentioned in the Skanda Purana as a notable Shaivite shrine. Its present architecture reflects multiple historical phases from Chola, Pandya, and Vijayanagara periods.

The temple is dedicated to Veerabhadra, a fierce form of Lord Shiva, believed to have been created by Shiva in his wrath. It showcases exquisite wall frescoes, murals depicting epics like the Ramayana and Mahabharata, and contains the famous “hanging pillar” and India’s largest monolithic Nandi (bull), carved from a single stone and located a few hundred meters away.

The temple complex includes shrines for Vishnu, Durga, and other deities, making it a diverse pilgrimage site.
