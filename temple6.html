        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>This ancient temple is located in Hamsaladeevi village, Krishna district, Andhra Pradesh, where the Krishna River meets the Bay of Bengal.

The temple is around 1000 years old and was built during the reign of the Eastern Chalukyas and later supported by the Pallava and Chola dynasties.

According to legend, two Gandharvas insulted a black-colored sage and were cursed to become crows. The curse was lifted when they bathed in the Krishna River near Hamsaladeevi and were transformed into swans (Hamsa), giving the place its name.

The temple is dedicated to Sri Venugopala Swamy, an incarnation of Lord Krishna, present here with his consorts Rukmini and Satyabhama.

The temple is famed for its architectural brilliance, including a five-tiered Raja Gopuram, Dhwaja Sthambham, and carvings depicting scenes from the Ramayana on the walls.

The temple has endured historic floods, notably in 1864 and 1977, which it survived and protected local villagers.It holds sub-shrines including Sri Janardhanaswamy, Sri Rajyalakshmi, and Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy.</p>
