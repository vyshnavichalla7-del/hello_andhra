        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            The temple is built in Dravidian style architecture. 


Origins / Builders:

Some foundations date back to the Chola dynasty (around 10th‑11th century CE). Kings like Rajendra Chola I, Kulottunga Chola I, and others made significant contributions. 


Later additions by the Vijayanagara rulers, especially Krishnadevaraya (in 1516) — the grand Gopuram (tower), the 100‑pillared hall etc. 

Key architectural elements:

The main Rajagopuram (front tower) is about 120 feet (≈ 36.5 m) high. 


A hundred‑pillared hall (Mandapam) built by Krishnadevaraya. 


Multiple prakarams (outer courtyards), shrines for other deities: Gnana Prasunambika (Parvati), Jnana Prasanna Mbba, Kasi Viswanatha, Suryanarayan, Subramanya, Annapurna, Sadyoganapathi etc. 


Pathala Ganapathi (an underground Ganapati shrine) in outer prakaram. 


The temple is located on the banks of the Swarnamukhi river. Also, hills around: Durgambika hill (north), Kannappa hill (south), Kumaraswamy hill (east), etc. The hill itself forms part of the boundary/walls in places. 

Recent Conservation Efforts:

Roof repair works (about 60,000 sq ft) were completed (2025) to arrest leakages. Natural & traditional materials used for waterproofing, with support from ASI and others. 
Deccan Chronicle

The Rajagopuram had collapsed in 2010, was reconstructed and consecrated in January 2017
<h3>temple legend</h3>
Pancha Bhoota Stalam: This temple represents the element Vayu (air) among the five fundamental elements in nature worshipped at the Pancha Bhoota Shiva temples. 


Vayu Lingam: The main Shiva-lingam here is believed to be self‑manifested, known earlier as Karpoora Lingam. The deity is worshipped as Vayu Lingam because of association with Vayu (the wind‑god). 


Legend of the spider, serpent and elephant: The name “Sri‑Kala‑Hasti” comes from stories of three devotees — a spider (Sri), a serpent (Kala), and an elephant (Hasti) — who each in different eras worshipped the Shiva-lingam with great devotion. Shiva granted them salvation. 


Devotee Kannappa: Perhaps the most famous legend — Kannappa (original name Thinnan), a hunter, is said to have offered water in his mouth, meat, even one of his eyes to the lingam when he saw blood to show his love and devotion. Shiva was pleased and granted him moksha
