        <h2>History</h2>
        <p> The temple dates back to the 13th century and belongs to the Chola Kingdom era, making it the oldest Surya temple in Anantapur district and the second oldest in Andhra Pradesh. It is also considered the third oldest Surya temple in South India and the eighth oldest in India.

It is unique in that the Surya deity faces south, which is rare among Surya temples. Legend notes that Lord Yama, the god of death and son of Surya, is the head of the south direction. Worshipping here is believed to bring health, wealth, and success to devotees, and the temple has a special significance regarding recovery from diseases.

The temple consists of three stones making up the structure where Surya is worshipped in three forms throughout the day: Brahma-roopa (morning), Maheswara (afternoon), and Swayam Vishnu (evening).

The famous spiritual leader Sri Sathya Sai Baba, who had connections to the nearby area, used to personally perform pujas at this temple, adding to its repute.
