        <h2>History</h2><p>
The Amaralingeswara Swamy Temple is a revered Hindu temple situated in Amaravathi, Guntur District, Andhra Pradesh. It is one of the five sacred Pancharama Kshetras, dedicated to Lord Shiva. The temple enshrines a 15-foot white marble Shiva Linga, believed to have been installed by Lord Indra. Legend has it that the Linga was growing in size, and to halt its expansion, a nail was driven into its top, causing blood to ooze out, leaving a permanent red stainâ€”a feature still visible today. 

The temple's origins trace back to the 11th century, with the earliest inscription dating to 1129 CE. It has been patronized by various dynasties, including the Kota chiefs and the Vijayanagara Empire, with notable contributions from Sri Krishnadevaraya. Major renovations were carried out in the late 18th century under the patronage of Vasireddy Venkatadri Nayudu, the Rajah of Chintapalli.</p>
