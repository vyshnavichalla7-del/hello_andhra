        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>This ancient temple is located in Kolletikota village near the shores of Kolleru Lake in Krishna district, Andhra Pradesh.

The temple was built in the 11th to 13th century by Ammadevarayulu, a general in the Eastern Ganga Dynasty, during the reign of King Narasingha Deva I.

Legend tells that during a war between the Gajapati rulers of Odisha and Muhammadin, the general sacrificed his daughter Peddintlamma to ensure victory. Post-victory, the temple was built in her honor as an incarnation of Goddess Parvathi.

The temple features Sri Peddintlamma as the presiding deity, regarded as the elder of all 108 Grama Devatas (village deities).

It is also known as Jala Durga Devi since the temple is located near the water body of Kolleru Lake.

The temple architecture includes a five-tiered Rajagopuram and a Dhwaja Stambham (flagstaff).The village and temple attract many devotees especially during the annual festival held from Palguna Sudha Padyami to Pournami, featuring cultural programs and rituals.
