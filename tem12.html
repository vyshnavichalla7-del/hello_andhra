        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            In the midst of the lush – green fields of the River Godavari the Konaseema area reminds one of the sanctity and sacred feeling described in the Vaastu Sastra. In this area of Konaseema is AINAVILLI, where the “SIDDI VINAYAKA TEMPLE” is situated. Before performing Daksha Yagna Daksha Prajapati was supposed to have performed puja of Vinayaka at this place for its successful completion. This is written in the “KSHETRA PURANA” of this place.There is another story that Vyasa Maharshi, during the beginning of his tour of the South, had installed the Son of Parvati at this place and this age – old “SIDDI VINAYAKA” is reputed to fulfill the wishes of his devotees.In a spacious, elevated area, this temple of Vinayaka stands with idol facing South. With two gopurams and gates, one can approach Vinayaka from the south and Sri Visveswara Swamy from the East.In the same compound is situated Sri Devi, Bhudevi with Sri Kesava Swamy. By the side are situated Sri Annnapurna Devi. Sri Kalabhairava Swamy and Kshetrapalaka are situated by the side.Special Pujas are performed every month on Chaviti, Dasami, Ekadasi days. During Vinayaka Chavithi Navarathri, Karthika Masam, Prabha festival on Sankranthi and Sivarathri special archanas are performed.
