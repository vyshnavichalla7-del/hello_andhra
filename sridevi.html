        <h2>History </h2><p>

The ashram's journey began with the consecration of the Rajarajeshwari Devi Panchaloha idol on October 27, 2004. Subsequently, idols of Sai Baba, Lakshmi Ganapati, Suryanarayana Swamy, and Sitaram were installed, enriching the spiritual ambiance of the ashram. In 2010, the main temple was consecrated, housing the principal deity, Sri Rajarajeshwari Ammavari Moolavirattu.

An architectural highlight of the ashram is the Shiva Temple, designed as Kailasa Prasthara, which houses 1,116 Shivalingas, symbolizing the ashram's commitment to preserving and nurturing sacred spirituality. The ashram follows the ancient wisdom of Sanatana Dharma, guiding seekers on the path of dharma, karma, and moksha through authentic Vedic traditions.

The ashram conducts daily pujas and rituals aimed at promoting peace and harmony in the world. Along with these pujas, the temple engages in ample service to the nearby villages and people. Activities such as Annadanam (food distribution) and Gau Seva (cow shelter) are performed regularly to support the local community.

The ashram is known for its positive and peaceful atmosphere, with many visitors mentioning feeling spiritually charged after their visit. The Sri Chakra and Shiva Lingas are well-maintained and clean, contributing to the serene environment.
