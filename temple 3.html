        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            The temple was established in 1695 A.D after the event of Yoga Agni Pravesam by Sri Lakshmi Tirupathamma, who is considered an incarnation of Goddess Shakti and a great devotee of Lord Venkateswara.

Sri Tirupatamma was known for her devotion, virtuous life, and teachings on Bhakti, Karma, Gnana, Vairagya, and Moksha. She was married to Sri Gopayya and faced many hardships and ill-treatment from her in-laws.

After an episode of Yoga Agni Pravesam (self-immolation by fire), several idols of Sri Lakshmi Tirupatamma and her husband Sri Gopayya appeared at the pyre site, where the temple was later constructed.

The temple is located in the Penuganchiprolu village, once known as Pedakanchi, which had a rich cultural heritage with over 101 ancient temples.

It is one of the most revered temples in the Krishna region, celebrated for its annual Tirunallu festival, attracting thousands of pilgrims.
