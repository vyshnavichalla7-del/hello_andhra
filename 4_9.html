        <h2>History</h2>
        <ul><li>location</li>
          
        <p>The Bhagavan Sri Venkaiah Swamy Temple in Golagamudi, located approximately 15 km from Nellore city in Andhra Pradesh, is a revered spiritual center dedicated to Bhagavan Sri Venkaiah Swamy, a sage believed to be an avatar of Lord Dattatreya.
        </p>
        <li>legend</li>
        <p>Bhagavan Sri Venkaiah Swamy was a spiritual luminary who lived in Golagamudi during the mid-20th century. He attained Mahasamadhi (a state of conscious exit from the physical body) at this location, and his teachings continue to inspire devotees. He emphasized compassion, simplicity, and service to humanity, with the guiding principle: “Feed the hungry, shelter the distressed.”
