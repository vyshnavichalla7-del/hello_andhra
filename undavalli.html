        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
             The Undavalli Caves are a remarkable example of monolithic Indian rock-cut architecture, located in the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh, approximately 12 km southwest of Vijayawada. These caves date back to the 4thâ€“5th centuries CE, during the rule of the Vishnukundina dynasty .

Originally, the caves served as Jain monastic dwellings, resembling the architecture of the Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves in Odisha. Over time, they evolved to accommodate Buddhist monks and later transformed into Hindu temples, reflecting the region's rich tapestry of religious history.

The most notable feature is the three-story structure carved into a sandstone hill, with the second floor housing a massive reclining Vishnu statue sculpted from a single block of granite. This statue is believed to represent Parshvanatha, the 23rd Tirthankara of Jainism, adorned with an eight-headed serpent canopy .

The architecture of the caves showcases a blend of Gupta-style rock-cut architecture, characterized by intricately carved pillars, shrines, and sculptures of various deities, including Shiva, Vishnu, and Brahma .
