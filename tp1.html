        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
        Kolleru Bird Sanctuary is located in the Eluru district of Andhra Pradesh, spread between the Krishna and Godavari river deltas. It protects part of Kolleru Lake, India's largest freshwater lake, which covers about 308 square kilometers. The sanctuary, established in 1999, is a Ramsar site recognized for its international ecological importance. It is a critical habitat for migratory and resident birds such as pelicans, painted storks, ibises, and herons. The lake and sanctuary provide essential wetland ecosystems that support rich biodiversity, including aquatic plants, fish, and numerous bird species. Kolleru Lake also acts as a natural flood-balancing reservoir between the Krishna and Godavari rivers, supporting local livelihoods through fishing and agriculture. The sanctuary offers opportunities for birdwatching, boat rides, and experiencing the natural beauty of Andhra Pradesh's wetland environment.
