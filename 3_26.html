          <ul><li>  Location:</li>
   
       Mallayyakonda Hills are located in Thamballapalle Mandal of Chittoor District, Andhra Pradesh.

The area is spiritually significant and known for its scenic beauty, surrounded by valleys and forested slopes.<p>
   <ul><li> Sri Bhramarambika Sametha Mallikarjuna Swamy Temple</li></ul>
 Main Deity:

The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva, worshipped here as Mallikarjuna Swamy.

He is accompanied by Goddess Bhramarambika, a form of Parvati.

The Shiva Lingam here is considered Swayambhu (self-manifested), making the site especially sacred.</p>
<p>It is believed that the temple was established during the reign of Sri Krishnadevaraya, the famous king of the Vijayanagara Empire.

According to local lore, a nearby hill called Sadhukonda was once used by sages for meditation. There is a belief that a mystical tunnel connects Sadhukonda to Mallayyakonda.

It is said that Lord Shiva traveled through this underground passage in the form of a rat, finally manifesting as the lingam at Mallayyakonda.

There is also a sacred water source nearby known as Yelaka Theertham, believed to be formed by divine grace.</p>


<p>The hill is surrounded by lush greenery and cool breezes, creating a tranquil environment for spiritual seekers.

Pilgrims enjoy not just the darshan but also the peaceful natural setting and panoramic views from the hilltop.
