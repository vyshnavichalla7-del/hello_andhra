        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
             The Guthikonda Caves, also known as Guttikonda Bilam, are a significant historical and spiritual site located near the village of Guthikonda, approximately 23 km from Gurazala in Guntur District, Andhra Pradesh. The term "Bilam" is derived from the Sanskrit word for "cave."

These caves are believed to have been used by ancient sages for meditation and are often referred to as "Dakshina Kasi" by locals, highlighting their spiritual significance. The area houses several temples dedicated to various deities, including Muchukunda Maha Muni, Anjaneya Swamy, and Sri Raja Rajeswari Devi. Additionally, numerous Shiva Lingas, such as Chikati Mallayya, are found within the caves. The caves also contain tombs of individuals who served pilgrims at this site. 

Historically, during the Palanati Yuddam (1182 AD), a significant battle was fought near these caves. It is believed that Palanati Brahma Naidu and his 66 warriors took refuge in these caves during the conflict. 

In 2008, a significant biological discovery was made in the caves. Dr. Shabuddin Shaik, a biospeleologist, identified a previously unknown species of micro-crustacean in the cave's waters, named Andhracoides shabuddin in his honor. This discovery underscores the caves' rich biodiversity and ecological importance.
