        <h2>History</h2>
        <p> The temple was built around 1510â€“1525 AD by Pemmasani Timmanayudu II, a chieftain during the Vijayanagara Empire and a contemporary of Vira Narasimharaya and Krishnadevaraya.

According to legend, villagers discovered an idol of Vishnu inside a tamarind tree ("Chintha chettu" in Telugu). Timmanayudu was inspired by a dream to build the temple and dedicated it to Lord Venkateswara, who became known as Chintala Venkataramana.

The temple sits on the banks of the Penna River and is revered for its stone chariot (Garuda Mandapa), compact yet similar in style to the famous chariot of Hampi.

It is recognized as a Monument of National Importance by the ASI due to exceptional Dravidian architecture, grandeur, and detailed sculptures from the Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Bhagavata Purana.
