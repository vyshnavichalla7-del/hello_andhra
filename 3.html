        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The temple's origins trace back to ancient times, with references found in Tamil Sangam literature dated to the 9th century CE, and the site itself believed to be endowed by King Thondaman and patronized by successive dynasties such as the Pallavas, Cholas, Pandyas, and especially the Vijayanagara Empire in the 14th-16th centuries .

According to legend, Lord Vishnu incarnated as Sri Venkateswara during the Kali Yuga and made Tirumala his abode to protect mankind. The place is thus called "Kaliyuga Vaikuntha," and the deity is "Kaliyuga Prathyaksha Daivam" .

The temple saw substantial expansion, wealth, and renovations during the Vijayanagara reign, especially under Emperor Krishnadevaraya, who contributed gold and jewels to adorn the inner sanctum, Ananda Nilayam .

Despite historical challenges under Muslim rule and invasions, the temple survived, thanks to continued patronage and protection from local rulers .

<h3>Temple Details & Features</h3>
The temple stands atop the seventh peak (Venkatadri) of the Seshachalam hills, part of a seven-peak range representing Adiseshaâ€™s seven hoods .
<h3>temple legend</h3>
1. Vishnuâ€™s Descent to Earth

According to legend, Lord Vishnu incarnated as Venkateswara and came down to Earth (Bhooloka) to save mankind from the trials and troubles of the Kali Yuga (the present age).

2. Sage Bhriguâ€™s Curse

Once, the sages were debating who among the Trimurtiâ€”Brahma, Vishnu, or Shivaâ€”was the greatest. Sage Bhrigu went to test each of them. When Lord Vishnu did not immediately greet him, Bhrigu kicked Him on the chest. Instead of getting angry, Vishnu gently pressed the sage's foot and removed the extra eye on his foot, calming his ego. But Goddess Lakshmi, residing in Vishnuâ€™s chest, was offended and left Vaikuntha.

3. Venkateswara Marries Padmavathi

Vishnu came to Earth to search for Lakshmi. He settled in the Seshachalam hills (Tirumala) and lived in an anthill. Goddess Lakshmi, in the meantime, took the form of Padmavathi, born to King Akasha Raja. Venkateswara and Padmavathi got married, and to finance the grand wedding, Venkateswara borrowed money from Kubera, the god of wealth.

ðŸ‘‰ It is believed that Lord Venkateswara is still repaying that debt, which is why devotees offer money and gold in large amounts.

4. Self-Manifested Idol (Swayambhu)

The deity of Lord Venkateswara is believed to be self-manifested (Swayambhu) and not man-made. The temple is located on Venkatadri Hill, one of the seven hills of Tirumala.
