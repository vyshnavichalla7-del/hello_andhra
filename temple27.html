        <h2>History</h2>
        <p> The temple was constructed during the 16th century and is attributed to Vijayanagara Empire architectural styles.

It features a prominent five-storied Gali Gopuram approximately 40 feet high, beautifully adorned with intricate carvings.

Historical records suggest that the main gopuram was built by Kanchi Kodanda Ramacharya, and the temple was expanded through various additions such as the Kalyana Mandapam (marriage hall) and Anjaneyaswami Vrindavan within a spacious courtyard.

The temple complex includes many mandapas like the Ranga Mandapam and Shayana Mandapam, where traditional wedding ceremonies are still held.

Renovations over time have added modern structures to the temple, but the original Vijayanagara style remains evident
