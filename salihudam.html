        <h2> History</h2><p>

Salihundam, originally known as Salipetaka (meaning "rice emporium" in Telugu), was a prominent center of Buddhist activity from the 2nd century BCE to the 12th century CE. The site was rediscovered in 1919 by Gidugu Venkata Rama Murthy, an early 20th-century scholar and social reformer.

Archaeological excavations have revealed numerous Buddhist stupas, chaityas (prayer halls), viharas (monasteries), and mandapas (pillared halls), reflecting the site's significance in the spread of Buddhism. Artifacts such as relic caskets and sculptures of Buddhist deities like Mareechi and Tara have been uncovered, showcasing the site's historical and cultural importance. 

Salihundam is notable for its role in the dissemination of Buddhism to Southeast Asia, including regions like Sumatra. The site's architectural and artistic remnants provide valuable insights into the evolution of Buddhist practices and the cultural exchanges between ancient India and Southeast Asia.

Architectural Heritage: The site features a blend of Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana Buddhist elements, illustrating the evolution of Buddhist architecture and practices over centuries.
