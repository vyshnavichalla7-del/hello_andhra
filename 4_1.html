        <h2>History</h2>
        <ul><li>location</li>
            located in talapagiri,nellore
        <p>
        </p>
        <li>legend</li>
        <p>The name “Talpagiri” is believed to come from the idea that Adi Sesha (the serpent upon whom Lord Vishnu rests) took the form of a hill at this location so that Lord Vishnu could reside on Earth with Goddess Sridevi.

According to temple lore, Lord Vishnu desired to dwell in Bhuloka (the Earth) along with Sridevi, so Adi Sesha transformed into a hillock here, becoming the foundation upon which the Lord resides.

Another local legend holds that the temple was intended to be like Srirangam (a famous Ranganatha temple in Tamil Nadu), and devotees called this place “Ranganayakulapeta.</p>
        <li>architecture</li>
        <p>The temple features a west-facing main deity (which is unusual, since many temples face east). The deity is in a reclining posture, resting on Adi Sesha.

The sanctum has Goddess Sridevi and Goddess Bhudevi as consorts to Vishnu. The imagery often shows the Lord reclining, with the hood of the serpent forming a canopy.

There is a large entrance tower (gopuram) that is prominent in height, with multiple gold finials / kalasams on top.

The walls of the sanctum include inscriptions or etchings of the Vishnu Sahasranama (thousand names of Lord Vishnu).

Near the temple, there is a sacred tree (“Santana Vriksha”) associated with blessings for children; devotees often tie offerings or cloth at the tree.</p>
