        <h2>History </h2>
        <p>
            The Sri Uma Rudra Koteswara Swamy Temple in Srikakulam, Andhra Pradesh, is a significant Hindu shrine dedicated to Lord Shiva. According to local legends, the temple was originally constructed by Lord Balarama, the elder brother of Lord Krishna, approximately 5,000 years ago. It is believed to be one of the five Shiva temples, collectively known as the Pancha Linga Kshetras, situated along the banks of the Nagavali River. These temples were established to facilitate human access to the Sri Kurmam Temple, which was initially accessible only to deities. Lord Balarama consecrated these temples to allow humans to seek permission from Lord Shiva before visiting the Sri Kurmam Temple .

In 1774, the temple underwent significant renovations under the patronage of Magatapalli Kamayya Setti from Konada village in the present-day Vizianagaram district. These renovations utilized red sandstone sourced from Salihundam, and the temple's architecture reflects traditional South Indian styles .

The temple is situated in Chinna Bharatham Colony, Srikakulam, and serves as a significant religious site for devotees in the region. It is particularly notable for its association with the Pancha Linga Kshetras, a group of five sacred Shiva temples believed to have been consecrated by Lord Balarama .
