        <h2>Aare Waterfalls – Overview</h2>
        <p>
Aare Waterfalls is a relatively lesser-known and scenic waterfall located near Chittoor district in Andhra Pradesh, India. It is often referred to as a hidden gem because it's tucked away in lush greenery, away from crowded tourist spots.</p>
<p>



Located about 20–25 km from Chittoor town.

The falls lie in the Eastern Ghats region, surrounded by forested hills and rocky terrain.

To reach the falls, visitors often have to trek or walk through a narrow forest path, which adds to its charm and adventure.</p>
<p>


The waterfall cascades over large rocky surfaces and forms a small pool or stream below.

Best visited during or just after the monsoon season (June to September), when the water flow is strong and the surrounding forest is lush green.

It’s an ideal spot for nature lovers, hikers, and photographers looking for peaceful, offbeat locations.
</p>
<p>


There is a mild to moderate trek required to reach the falls from the nearest point accessible by vehicle.

The trek usually takes 30–45 minutes, depending on your pace and the weather.

The path can be slippery during the rainy season, so proper footwear is recommended.
