        <h2>History</h2>
        <p> The temple dates back to the 11th century and is one of the ancient temples located on the northern bank of the Krishna River in Muktyala village, Jaggaiahpet Mandal, Krishna District, Andhra Pradesh.

It is constructed in the Kalinga architectural style, which is prominent in Odisha, and is considered one of the earliest examples of this temple style.

The temple is believed to have been established by Bali Chakravarthi and has mythological significance connected to Sage Bharadwaja and the Krishna River's unique northward flow called Uttaravahini at this site.

There are two prominent Shiva Lingams accompanied by two Nandi statues, one called the "Tirugu Nandi," which holds special significance for devotees, especially women praying for a safe childbirth.

The temple complex consists mainly of Mukteswara Swamy, Sri Chakra Sahita Bhavani Matha, and Chennakeshwara Swamy shrines.
