        <h2>history</h2><p>
          <ul><li>  Location:</li>
   
        It is located near Narayanavanam, about 7 km away, toward Nagileru village.

The temple sits on a small hill by the Singirikona Waterfalls.

To reach it you go up some steps (approx. ~50 feet rise). There is a “pakka” (paved) road for part of the ascent.

<li>Legends:</li>
The main deity is Lord Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy with Goddess Lakshmi.

There is a temple tank (“theertham”) and a small waterfall (called Bala Theertham) near the temple. Pilgrims often bathe in the water before darshan.

The temple flooring is leveled/paved; ceilings are decorated/painted.
<p>
Lakshmi Narasimha is the form of Vishnu as Narasimha (half‐man, half‐lion) with Goddess Lakshmi, usually associated with protection, removal of fear, and grace. Most legends relate to Prahlada’s devotion and how Narasimha appeared to save him.</p>
<h3>architecture</h3>
Many Lakshmi Narasimha temples follow Dravidian style or regional styles. Deity may be “Ugra” (fierce) or “Saumya” (gentle) form. The shrine usually has an image or murti of Narasimha, along with Lakshmi. Temples often have water tanks, steps, gopurams, mandapams.
