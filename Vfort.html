        <h2>History</h2><p>
Vizianagaram Fort was constructed in 1713 by Maharaja Vijaya Rama Raju I, the founder of the Vizianagaram Kingdom.
It was built on land considered auspicious by the Muslim saint Mahabub Valli, who was performing penance in the area.
The fort played a significant role during the Bobbili War of 1757, a major conflict between the rulers of Vizianagaram and Bobbili, reflecting the region’s turbulent history.
The architecture of the fort shows a mix of traditional and Rajasthani styles, featuring massive walls, gates, and structures like the Moti Mahal (Durbar Hall) and Clock Tower.

Vizianagaram Fort is a symbol of the Pusapati dynasty’s power and heritage.
It stands as a major historical and cultural landmark in the region, showcasing the legacy of ancient architecture and royal governance.
The fort is known for its architectural beauty and is an important site for understanding the political and cultural history of Andhra Pradesh.
It attracts historians, tourists, and devotees who are interested in the region’s royal past and architectural marvels.</p>
