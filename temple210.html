        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>  The temple's origins date back around 500 years, during the Vijayanagara Empire under the rule of Sri Krishnadevaraya. The spiritual leader Sri Vyasaraya is credited with building the temple to enshrine Lord Subramanyeshwara Swamy in his multi-headed form (Sapta-mukha or seven-headed form), which symbolizes different spiritual principles.

Numerous sages and yogis are said to have performed penance here historically, making the region a holy spiritual center.

The central idol is carved from a single rock depicting the serpent form of Lord Subramanya, displaying distinct attributes symbolizing various tattvas (spiritual truths) such as Yoga Tattva, Kala Tattva along with the Sri Chakra representing the Shakti aspect of Goddess Parvati.

The temple experienced renovation and rejuvenation, especially in 2008, led by spiritual leaders who also added shrines for Shiva and Parvati within the complex
