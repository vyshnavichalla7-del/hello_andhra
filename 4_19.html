Irrigation: The primary purpose of Somasila Dam is to provide water for irrigation. It supports thousands of acres of agricultural land in the Penna delta and nearby regions.

Drinking Water: Supplies water to towns and villages including Nellore city and others.

Flood Control: Helps regulate the flow of the Penna River and prevents flooding during heavy monsoons.

Inter-Basin Link: It is part of the Telugu Ganga Project, which diverts Krishna River water through multiple reservoirs (including Kandaleru) to Chennai for drinking purposes.

<li>Structure & Capacity</li>

The dam is a combination of earth-fill and gravity structure.

Full Reservoir Level (FRL): Around 100.58 meters above mean sea level.

Storage Capacity: About 78 TMC (Thousand Million Cubic Feet).

Water Spread Area: Over 212 square kilometers when the reservoir is full.

The dam includes sluice gates and spillways to control water release during heavy inflows.
