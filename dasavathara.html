        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            The Sri Dasavatara Venkateswara Swamy Temple is a prominent Vaishnavite shrine located in Namburu, Guntur District, Andhra Pradesh. Situated near the RainTree Park in the IJM Township, the temple is approximately 12 km from Guntur city and opposite Acharya Nagarjuna University. It is dedicated to Lord Venkateswara, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu, and is renowned for its unique feature: the Dasavatara (Ten Avatars) of Lord Vishnu are depicted in intricate carvings and sculptures within the temple complex.

The temple is also known as Sri Dasavatara Srinivasa Devasthanam and is a significant spiritual center for devotees in the region. It houses shrines for Mahalakshmi, Ganapati, Garuda, and Vishvaksena, making it a comprehensive Vaishnavite temple complex. The temple is managed by the Sri Venkateswara Swamy Kalyana Trust, which also oversees the Nithyannadana (free meal) program, a charitable initiative to provide meals to devotees and the underprivileged.
