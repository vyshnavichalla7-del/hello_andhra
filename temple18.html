        <h2>History</h2>
        <p> The temple is believed to have origins dating back to the Dwapara Yuga. According to mythology, this is the place where Lord Sri Krishna along with Sri Satyabhama killed the demon Narakasura, who was a great devotee of Lord Shiva.

Narakasura worshipped Lord Shiva, who appeared as Sri Prudheswara Swamy (self-manifested Shiva Lingam) in this temple.

The temple is located on the banks of the Krishna River facing west and is associated with purification and liberation rites.

The region's ancient name was Narakatta (later Nadakuduru), linked to the Narakasura legend.

The temple complex includes deities of Lord Shiva, Bala Tripurasundari (Goddess), and Veera Bhadra Swamy.

Nearby is the notable Patalivana (Paatali tree forest) considered sacred, one of only a few such natural groves in India.
