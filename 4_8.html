        <h2>History</h2>
        <ul><li>location</li>
          
        <p>There is a Sai Darbar (Sai Baba temple) in Nellore city where devotees regularly gather for worship and spiritual events.
        </p>
        <li>legend</li>
        <p>Sai Baba of Shirdi is the saint whom these temples honor. He lived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and is considered a spiritual master who transcended religious boundaries.

The legend says Sai Baba performed many miracles, healed the sick, and preached love, tolerance, and self-realization.

Sai Baba emphasized faith (Shraddha) and patience (Saburi), and many devotees believe visiting Sai Darbar Baba brings peace, healing, and blessings.

The Nellore Sai Darbar is considered a spiritual hub where devotees feel the saint’s presence and grace, often sharing stories of answered prayers and miraculous help.

        <li>architecture</li>
        <p>.
         Design Style: Sai Darbar temples typically blend simple yet serene architectural elements focusing on creating a spiritual ambiance rather than grandiosity.

Sanctum (Garbhagriha):
The central shrine houses a statue or idol of Sai Baba, often depicted sitting on a stone or throne, wearing a simple robe and headscarf, with a calm and compassionate expression.

Mandapam (Hall):
The prayer hall is designed to accommodate devotees during aartis and bhajan sessions. It usually features open space with seating arrangements and decorated pillars or arches.

Entrance:
The entrance might have an arch or small gopuram-style tower, sometimes adorned with Sai Baba's image or symbols like the sacred fire lamp (diya).

Decorations:
Inside the temple, walls may have paintings or photographs depicting important events from Sai Baba’s life, his miracles, and teachings.

Materials:
Many Sai Darbar temples use marble or granite flooring and simple wooden or metal elements for doors and windows, aiming to keep the environment peaceful and welcoming.

Additional Features:
Some temples include a small meditation room or a space for community gatherings and free food distribution (annadanam).
