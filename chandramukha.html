        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
        The Chaturmukha Brahma Lingeshwara Temple is a unique and historic temple located in Chebrolu, Guntur District, Andhra Pradesh. This temple is one of the few in India dedicated to Lord Brahma, featuring a distinctive four-faced (Chaturmukha) idol of Brahma on all four sides of a central Shiva Lingam. This rare configuration makes it a significant site for devotees and historians alike.

The temple's origins are believed to date back to the Chola dynasty, with contributions from subsequent dynasties such as the Chalukyas, Pallavas, and Kakatiyas, reflecting the region's rich cultural and architectural heritage. The current structure was reconstructed approximately 200 years ago by Raja Vasireddy Venkatadri Naidu, a prominent ruler of the region, who also contributed to the restoration of several other temples in the area. 

The temple is situated in the middle of a tank, accessible via a small bridge, and is surrounded by smaller shrines dedicated to Lord Shiva, Lord Vishnu, and Goddess Shakti in her various forms. This layout symbolizes the harmonious coexistence of the trinity of Hindu deities.
