        <p>
          Sri Satyanarayana Swamy Temple in Eluru district is most famously represented by the Sri Veera Venkata Satyanarayana Swamy Temple located on Ratnagiri Hill near Annavaram, Andhra Pradesh, which is in the neighboring East Godavari district. This temple, constructed in 1891 by Raja Ramanarayana, the Zamindar of Gorasa and Kirlampudi estates, has a unique Trimurti idol representing Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva together. The temple architecture resembles a chariot with four wheels at each corner, and it sits atop a hill with about 460 stone steps leading to it. The temple worship includes Lord Satyanarayana Swamy in the center, with Goddess Anantha Lakshmi and Lord Shiva on either side, highlighting a unique unity of deities. The temple is very significant for devotees performing Satyanarayana Vratam for blessings of prosperity, health, and well-being, and the site offers panoramic views of the Bay of Bengal and Eastern Ghats.
