        <h2>overview</h2>
        <p>
            Kondapalli Killa Waterfalls is located in the Kondapalli Reserve Forest near Kondapalli village in Krishna district, Andhra Pradesh.

The waterfalls are part of a larger forest ecosystem known for its natural beauty, trekking trails, and diverse wildlife including peacocks, sambar deer, barking deer, and occasional sightings of leopards and wild dogs.

The falls are seasonal and relatively small but set in a lush, green forest that offers a peaceful escape and great nature experience.

Kondapalli is also famous for its historic Kondapalli Fort and the traditional Kondapalli wooden toys (Bommalu).

The trekking trails to the waterfalls can be rocky and challenging, so good trekking shoes and an early start are recommended.

The forest and waterfalls are ideal for outdoor enthusiasts, photographers, and nature lovers.
