        <p>
            Sri Vasavi Devi is worshipped primarily by the Arya Vysya (Komati) community across Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and parts of South India.

She is considered a form of Goddess Parvati and is revered as a symbol of peace, sacrifice, chastity, and dharma.

Known as Kanyaka Parameswari — "Kanyaka" meaning virgin and "Parameswari" meaning Supreme Goddess.
        </p>
        <li>legend</li>
        <p>.Vasavi Devi was born to King Kusuma Sreshti and Queen Kusumamba, rulers of a prosperous Vysya kingdom in Penugonda.

She was known for her spiritual wisdom, compassion, and beauty.

When a powerful king demanded to marry her against her will, she chose self-sacrifice (Agni Pravesham — entering the sacred fire) rather than compromise her dharma and chastity.

Along with her, 102 Gotra leaders also chose self-sacrifice, representing unity and sacrifice for virtue.

After this divine act, she was venerated as Kanyaka Parameswari, an embodiment of Shakti.
