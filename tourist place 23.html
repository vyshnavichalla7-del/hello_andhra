        <h2>History</h2>
        <p> Sai Baba's initial "old mandir" for devotees was built in 1944. Prasanthi Nilayam's construction began in 1948 and was inaugurated on November 23, 1950, coinciding with Sai Baba's 25th birthday.

Sai Baba himself supervised the ashram's architecture and design, with the building painted blue for spirit, yellow for intellect, and pink for heartâ€”symbolizing a harmonious blend resulting in supreme peace.

Over the years, Prasanthi Nilayam has expanded to include the Sai Kulwant Hall (main darshan hall), Poornachandra Auditorium, spiritual museums, Sathya Sai General Hospital, schools, and charitable institutes.

Puttaparthi transitioned from a tiny remote village to a world-renowned spiritual township, hosting millions of visitors and serving as the nucleus for Sri Sathya Sai Baba's humanitarian and educational initiatives.

Sai Baba resided here most of the year, and the ashram remains his Mahasamadhi (resting place), with major festivals like his birthday and Guru Purnima attracting immense crowds. </p>
