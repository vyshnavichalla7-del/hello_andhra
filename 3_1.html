        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The temple was originally constructed in the early 11th century CE by the Chola king Kulottunga Chola I. 

It was later expanded in 1336 by the rulers of the Vijayanagara Empire. 
</p>
<p>



The temple follows Dravidian architecture. 


Construction is primarily with granite stones. 



There is a three‑storied Rajagopuram (main entrance tower). 

The temple complex is surrounded by a high wall enclosing the structures. 
</p>
<p>



The main deity (Ganesha / Vinayaka) idol is swayambhu (self‑manifested) and is located in a well which is always filled with water. The water remains at that level throughout the year. 


Only parts of the idol are visible above water currently (the knee and abdomen) — earlier armour or kavacha that used to fit earlier no longer fits because the idol has “grown” in size. 

There are multiple mandapams (pavilions) in front of the sanctum: an inner pavilion, a front pavilion, and larger ones (Mushika and Maha mandapams) for devotees. 


Other shrines are part of the complex: for Vinayaka’s companions, etc. Also there is a Manikantheswara temple and Varadaraja temple from Chola period inside the complex. 


There is a water‑tank or Koneru (temple tank) facing the Rajagopuram. 
<h3>temple legend</h3>
The temple is dedicated to Lord Ganesha, known here as Sri Varasidhi Vinayaka Swamy (also “Varasiddhi”). “Varasidhi” meaning “Grantor of boons and blessings.” 


It is famous for its swayambhu (self-manifested) idol of Ganesha, which is housed in a well that always has water. 


One of the legends: Three brothers—one blind, one deaf, one dumb— were working in the fields and digging a well for water. During digging, their tool hit something hard, water turned red (as if with blood), and miraculously the brothers were cured of their disabilities. Then the deity was found in the well. 


Another belief: the idol is gradually growing in size over time. 
Culture and Heritage


The name “Kanipakam” is said to mean something like “flow of water into a wetland / wet land” (Kani = wetland, Pakam = flow into) because the site has constant water in the well.
