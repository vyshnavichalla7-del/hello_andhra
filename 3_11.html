</li>Gurramkonda Fort is a historic hill fort located in Gurramkonda village, Annamayya District, Andhra Pradesh (previously part of Chittoor District).

Built atop a steep hill about 500 feet high, the fort offers panoramic views of the surrounding plains.

The name "Gurramkonda" means "Horse Hill" — “Gurram” = horse, “Konda” = hill — believed to reference the use of horses to climb or guard the steep terrain.

🔍 Historical Importance</li>
<li>
    The fort dates back to the 14th century, built during the rule of the Vijayanagara Empire.

It was later occupied by various rulers, including:

Nawabs of Kadapa

Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan

Eventually came under British control.

The fort played a strategic military role due to its naturally defensible position

Built using stone, lime, and mud, the fort blends Indo-Islamic and South Indian styles.

Key structures within or near the fort:

Rangini Mahal – an old palace structure, once used by royalty.

Tomb of Mir Raza Ali Khan – maternal uncle of Tipu Sultan.

Temples – small, centuries-old Hindu temples still present in and around the hill.

Mosques and Islamic structures – added during Muslim rule.

Steep natural terrain forms part of its defense; three sides are surrounded by deep slopes.
