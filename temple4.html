        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The Paritala Hanuman Temple is renowned for its towering statue of Lord Hanuman, standing approximately 135 feet (41 meters) tall, making it one of the tallest Hanuman statues in the world.

Located in Paritala village near Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, the temple was constructed around this massive monolithic statue, which serves as the temple's centerpiece.

Legend states the original statue's location was near the Krishna River, and after its discovery, locals decided to build the temple there. The temple has since become a popular pilgrimage spot.

The temple complex includes other shrines dedicated to Lord Shiva, Goddess Sita, Lord Rama, and others, highlighting its rich religious significance.

The statue was installed in 2003 through contributions from local donors and enthusiasts and symbolizes strength, courage, and devotion.
