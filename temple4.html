        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          Sri Jaganmohini Kesava Swamy Temple in Ryali, East Godavari district, Andhra Pradesh, is a unique temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu in his Mohini avatar on the back side of the idol, while the front side depicts Lord Kesava (Vishnu). The idol is carved from a single black stone (Salagrama), showcasing two forms on the front and back, a rare artistic marvel. According to legend, during the cosmic churning of the ocean (Samudra Manthan), Vishnu took the form of Mohini to distribute the nectar of immortality (Amritha) to the gods, deceiving the demons. Lord Shiva, enchanted by the beauty of Mohini, followed her, and a flower fell from her hair at this spot, hence the name "Ryali" meaning "falling" in Telugu. The temple was originally constructed in the 11th century by Chola King Vikrama Deva and renovated in 1936. Nearby, the Uma Kamandaleswara Swamy Temple dedicated to Lord Shiva faces the Vishnu temple, making this site spiritually significant with both deities worshipped in close proximity.
