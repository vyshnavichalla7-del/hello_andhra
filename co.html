        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>It is at a distance of about 15 Km from Kakinada on Kakinada Yanam Road. Coringa Sanctuary, named after a tiny village coringa in East Godavari District of Andhra Pradesh a part of Godavari Mangroves was declared as a wildlife sanctuary by Govt. of Andhra Pradesh vide G.O.Ms.No – 484, Forests and Rural Development (For.III) Department dated 5-7-1978 was to conserve the mangrove vegetation of the estuary, extending in an area of about 235.Sq.Kms. It is located between 16o-30′ to 17o-00′ N latitudes and 82o-14′ to 82o-23’E longitudes. Mangroves are salt – tolerent forest ecosystems of tropical and sub – tropical intertidal regions of the world. They normally occur between high waterlevel and near about mean sea level along the sheltered shores, estuaries, tidal creeks, back-waters, lagoons, marshes and mud-flats.Where conditions favour the Mangroves may form extensive and productive forests in the sheltered coastal lines. The mangrovees contain a highly specialised community of plants associated with animal species which are not capable of surviving in any other situations. Mangrove occur in Andhra Pradesh in estuaries of Krishna and Godavari rivers. Andhra Pradesh has got an area of 582 Sq.KM.of Mangrove forests, accounting for about 9% of local forest area of the State, which amounts to just about 2% of the local geographical area of the State. Even the entire land under mangroves do not contain fully the Mangrove vegetation. The area includes forest of open blanks. Sandy patches and Mud-flats.
