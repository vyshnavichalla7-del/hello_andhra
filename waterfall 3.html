        <h2>overview</h2>
        <p>
            Paritala Waterfalls, also called Kondapalli waterfalls or Paritala Hanuman waterfalls, are located near Paritala village and Kondapalli forest, close to Vijayawada in Krishna district, Andhra Pradesh.

These are small seasonal cascades nestled within the lush, wooded Kondapalli hills, offering a beautiful natural getaway.

The nearby Paritala Hanuman temple is a notable landmark, adding spiritual significance to the visit.

The area is favored for short trekking trips through rocky and forested terrain, with a rugged trail that may be slippery and challenging.

Water flow peaks during the monsoon and post-monsoon months, making it the prime season to experience the falls.

Pollution and littering near the falls have been reported, so visitors are encouraged to maintain cleanliness.
Due to the somewhat difficult access and small size of the falls, the spot may be less suited for families with children.
