        <h2>history</h2><p>
          <ul><li>  Location:</li>
          

Situated at the base of the Tirumala Hills, approximately 3 km from the Tirupati Railway Station, the temple is easily accessible by road and is a prominent pilgrimage site in the region
<li>Legends:</li>
The Sri Kapileswara Swamy Temple is the only temple in Tirupati dedicated solely to Lord Shiva, making it a vital part of the pilgrimage circuit for devotees. Its serene environment, coupled with the sacred waterfall, offers a tranquil experience for visitors.
<p>The temple is closely linked to the sage Kapila Muni, who is believed to have performed intense penance at this spot. According to legend, Kapila Muni was a great sage who wanted to cleanse himself of sins and attain spiritual liberation.

To aid him in his penance, Lord Shiva appeared here in the form of Kapileswara Swamy (the Lord of Kapila) as a self-manifested Shiva Lingam. It is said that the sage created a waterfall here by divine power, which now flows as the Kapila Theertham waterfall beside the temple.

This holy water is considered highly purifying, and devotees believe that taking a dip here washes away sins and grants spiritual blessings.

The temple’s connection to Kapila Muni makes it a sacred place for those seeking Shiva’s grace and spiritual solace. The presence of the waterfall adds to the divine ambiance, symbolizing purity and continuous flow of divine energy.</p>
