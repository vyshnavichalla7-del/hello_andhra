        <p>
            The Panchamukha Anjaneya Swamy Temple is a revered Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Hanuman, located in Piduguralla, Guntur District, Andhra Pradesh. The temple is renowned for housing a magnificent 45-foot Panchamukha (five-faced) Hanuman statue, making it one of the tallest of its kind in the region.

Situated approximately 68 km from Guntur on the Hyderabad-Guntur State Highway No. 2, Piduguralla is also known as the "Lime City of Andhra Pradesh" due to its rich limestone deposits . The temple is easily accessible via road and rail, with the South Central Railway line passing through the town.

The five faces of the statue represent various forms of Lord Hanuman, each symbolizing different aspects of his divine nature. The temple's architecture and the grandeur of the statue attract numerous devotees and tourists alike.
