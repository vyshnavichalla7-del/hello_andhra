        <h2>overview</h2>
        <p>
            Kondapalli Waterfalls, located near Kondapalli Fort in Krishna district, Andhra Pradesh, are small but scenic seasonal waterfalls nestled in the Kondapalli Reserve Forest.

The Kondapalli forest area is rich in biodiversity, with peacocks, deer, wild dogs, and other wildlife.

The waterfalls are part of multiple small cascades spread across the hill ranges around Kondapalli, popular among trekkers and nature lovers.

The trekking route to the waterfalls is moderately challenging, with rocky and rugged terrain, requiring proper trekking shoes.

Kondapalli Fort, a historical fort near the waterfalls, adds cultural and historical significance to the visit. The fort offers panoramic views of the surrounding forest and villages.

Kondapalli is also famous for its traditional wooden toys called Kondapalli Bommalu, handcrafted using local light wood.
