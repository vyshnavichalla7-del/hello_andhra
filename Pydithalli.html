        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
           

The origins of the temple date back to the 18th century. According to local legends, Goddess Pydithalli Ammavaru is considered the Grama Devata (village deity) of Ponduru. It is believed that the goddess's idol was discovered near the village, leading to the establishment of the temple in her honor.

The temple's significance grew over time, becoming a central place of worship for the local community. Devotees believe that the goddess offers protection and blessings to the villagers, safeguarding them from adversities.
        
The temple showcases traditional South Indian temple architecture, featuring a small sanctum (garbhagriha), a spacious hall (mandapam), and a beautifully adorned tower (shikhara). The deity, Pydithalli Ammavaru, is typically represented in a clay idol form, symbolizing purity and devotion.

The temple is renowned for its annual Sirimanothsavam festival, held on the first Tuesday after Dussehra. The main ritual involves a priest ascending a 40-foot wooden pole (Srimanu) and sitting atop it, symbolizing the goddess's presence. The festival attracts thousands of devotees and includes various cultural and religious events.</p>
