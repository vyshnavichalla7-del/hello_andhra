        <h2>history</h2><p>
          <ul><li>  Location:</li>
            The Sri Veda Narayana Swamy Temple is an ancient and significant Hindu temple located in Nagalapuram, approximately 60 km southeast of Tirupati in Chittoor District, Andhra Pradesh. This temple is dedicated to Lord Vishnu in his Matsya Avatar (the Fish incarnation), making it a unique and revered site for devotees.
          



<li>Legends:</li>
According to the temple's Sthala Purana, during the creation of the world, the demon Somakasura stole the Vedas from Lord Brahma and hid them in the ocean, disrupting the creation process. To restore the Vedas, Lord Vishnu assumed the form of Matsya, a fish, to retrieve them. The temple commemorates this event, with the deity depicted in the Matsya form, symbolizing the restoration of knowledge and order.


<h3>architecture</h3>
<p>
    The temple is constructed in the Vijayanagara architectural style, characterized by its grandeur and intricate carvings. The main deity, Sri Veda Narayana Swamy, is depicted in a standing posture with a fish-like tail, flanked by Sridevi and Bhudevi. Notably, the deity holds the Sudarshana Chakra in a ready-to-release posture, emphasizing the readiness to protect and uphold righteousness.

An architectural marvel of the temple is the Surya Puja that occurs annually. During the Phalguna month (typically in March), on the 12th, 13th, and 14th days of the waxing moon, the rays of the setting sun pass through the temple's Gopuram and illuminate the deity's feet, chest, and forehead, respectively, between 6:00 and 6:15 PM. This phenomenon, known as "Surya Puja," is considered a rare and auspicious event.
